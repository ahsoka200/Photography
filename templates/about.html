        <p>My name is Chris Austin. I live in Los Altos, California. I have been interested in photography for a few years now. Both my parents are amateur photographers and my dad is a painter. I grew up around cameras and art. Last year my work was featured at SFAI along with my classmateâ€™s work in their Digital Photography Program. I shoot most of my photos with a Cannon EOS 7D. This website will continue to grow as my work increases.</p>
